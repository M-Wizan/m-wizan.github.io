I am a doctoral researcher at the Herman Deleeck Centre for Social Policy, University of Antwerp. My research interests include: labour economics, economics of education, development economics, and social policy. While I have a background in economics, I particularly enjoy engaging in interdisciplinary research, drawing insights from other fields such as sociology, as well as social and public policy. With my strong quantitative background and passion for learning, I am always eager to explore new methods and approaches to strengthen my research and broaden my perspective. 

My PhD dissertation focuses on income and earnings inequality in Belgium, with particular emphasis on documenting volatility from a longitudinal perspective. Specifically, my research investigates the vulnerability of different socio-demographic groups in terms of the instability of their earnings and income histories. I use both survey data (e.g., EU-SILC, EU-LFS) and large scale administrative data, to study and decompose inequality and volatility. My research aims to provide a deeper understanding into the dynamics of these risks across gender, education levels and generations, among other dimensions. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing video and board games, playing and listening to music (electric bass and trombone), and cooking. I also love travelling the globe together with my husband, and exploring different cultures and perspectives.
